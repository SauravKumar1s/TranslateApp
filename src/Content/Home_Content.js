          "In the text box on the left, enter words or phrases that you want to translate in a complete sentence. After a few seconds, the text will be translated into the language selected on the right drop-down menu. You can also click on the “translate” button for immediate translation.",

        title: "How does text translation work?",
        description:
          "Whenever you translate phrases, sentences or even large texts - we send API requests to Google. This request consists of the text you have requested to translate along with the source and target language you have chosen from the drop-down menu. In return, Google sends a response back with the translated text.Behind the scenes, Google algorithms use a neural machine translation - a “deep learning” practice that compares whole sentences at a time from a broader range of linguistic sources. This has brought many advantages over conventional phrase-based translation systems and as a result, it is able to translate with a greater accuracy giving the full context rather than just sentence clauses in isolation.",
